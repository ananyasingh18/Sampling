# Sampling



We use a given dataset which is imbalanced and are required to firstly attain a balanced dataset and further use 5 sampling methods on 5 Ml models.

We Determine which techniwue gives higher accuracy for which model chosen.

Models chosen here are :
1.Logistic Regression      
2.Naive Bayes            
3.KNN                   
4.Decision Tree           
5.Random Forest Classifier 


Step one: Balancing the imbalanced dataset:
no of rows belonging to class 0: 763
no of rows belonging to class 1: 9
There are two main approaches to random resampling for imbalanced classification; they are oversampling and undersampling.
Random Oversampling: Randomly duplicate examples in the minority class.
Random Undersampling: Randomly delete examples in the majority class.
